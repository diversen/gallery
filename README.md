Test

Gallery module which supports HTML drivers for displaying 
the gallery. 

So far there is 3 drivers. 

* fancebox
* inline
* simplethumbs

The first one uses fancybox
The next uses inline images, which is good for SEO
The simplethumbs is used other modules, where you want e.g. a
shop item connected to a gallery.
